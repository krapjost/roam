Pacman stores all downloaded packages in ~/var/cache/pacman/pkg/~.
It does not remove the old and uninstalled packages automatically.
This is intended behavior for handling situations like downgrading
a package without retrieve the previous version through the Arch Linux Archive.

* Check size of cached packages
#+begin_src shell
du -sh /var/cache/pacman/pkg/
#+end_src

* Cleaning the cache manually
#+begin_src shell
# delete cached packages that are not installed
sudo pacman -Sc
# delete caches including those that are currently installed.
sudo pacman -Scc
#+end_src
